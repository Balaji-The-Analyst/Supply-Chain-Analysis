# Supply Chain Analysis
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

## Here are the questions I was interested in answering
1) What are the target values for OT%, IF%, and OTIF%, and how do our current metrics compare to these targets?
2) How many days, on average, are orders delayed from the agreed delivery date, and what factors contribute most to these delays?
3) Which customers (e.g., Lotus Mart, Coolblue, Acclaimed Stores) experience the highest number of delayed orders, and what are the common reasons for these delays?
4) Which specific products (e.g., Ghee, curd, butter) are most frequently delayed in delivery, and what can be done to improve their production and delivery timelines?
5) Have there been any trends or changes in the key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) over the past few months, and what actions can be taken to address the lack of noticeable improvements?



## I took the following steps to create my analysis 
1) Retrieved data from Excel files containing relevant information.
2) Ensured data integrity by cleaning and preparing it for analysis, removing any inconsistencies or errors.
3) Identified and established essential KPIs crucial for performance evaluation.
4) Developed charts and visual representations to effectively communicate insights derived from the data.
5) Implemented slicers to enable dynamic filtering and exploration of data.
6) Constructed a comprehensive dashboard integrating all components for easy monitoring and analysis.

## Here are my key takeaways
1) The target values for OT%, IF%, and OTIF% are not met, with current metrics significantly below the desired targets.
2) Orders are delayed by an average of 0.42 days, primarily due to incorrect delivery date estimations and higher-than-expected order volumes.
3) Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores have the highest delayed orders, mainly due to inaccurate delivery date estimations and excessive orders.
4) Ghee, curd, and butter are the most delayed products, requiring improved production efficiency and better demand forecasting.
5) No significant improvements in OT%, IF%, and OTIF% have been observed, necessitating enhanced production, supply chain management, and accurate forecasting.
